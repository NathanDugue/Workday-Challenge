# Workday-Challenge

 A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This is created to apply the past, present, or future class to each time block by comparing the id to the current hour. The time starts from 9am and ends at 5pm.
